# Overview

Video based course by [Dan Sullivan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dansullivanpdx/), who also wrote the [Official Study Guide](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Official+Google+Cloud+Certified+Associate+Cloud+Engineer+Study+Guide-p-9781119564416).

You can purchase the course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/google-certified-associate-cloud-engineer-2019-prep-course/). Please note that Udemy has a very agressive way of discounting their courses, so please do not pay more than 10â‚¬ for it. This course was even offered for free when I got it.
